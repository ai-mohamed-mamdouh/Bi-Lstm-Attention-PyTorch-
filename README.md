#  Resume Classification using Bi-LSTM + Attention

##  Project Overview

This project aims to build a **Resume Classification model** using **Deep Learning techniques**, specifically a **Bi-LSTM model with an Attention mechanism** implemented using **PyTorch**.

The project was developed to apply theoretical knowledge in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** into a complete, practical end-to-end implementation.

##  Objective

* Apply a **Bidirectional LSTM** model to understand contextual information from both directions (Forward & Backward).
* Use an **Attention Mechanism** to help the model focus on the most important words within each resume.
* Build a complete pipeline that includes:

  *  Dataset Preparation
  *  DataLoader Creation
  *  Model Architecture
  *  Training
  *  Testing
  *  Error Analysis
  *  Model Saving
